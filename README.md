# Image Compressor

## Author

## Description
We built the K-means algorithm and apply it to compress images. The code is written in Python language with no use of scikit-learn library.   

## Dataset

* Display the image to compress (.png or .jpg)
* Transform the original data to make it adequate for processing
* Construction of the K-means algorithm in four steps:
  1) Random initialization of K centroids (representing the K colors)
  2) Associate each register/pixel with the closest centroid
  3) Actualization of centroids
  4) Iteration until convergence is reached
* Construction of compressed images with several K colors
* Compute the size of the compressed image
